# How to Contribute
- Look in the ["Issues"](https://github.com/IMACULGY/CPPExamples/issues) section of the repository to look for available prompts.
- Fork and clone the repository locally to work on one of the prompts.
- Once the program is completed, commit the changes and push them to your forked repo.
- **Please copy/paste the prompt you worked on from the issue and add it as a comment at the beginning of your code**
- Please also include documentation in the form of comments for your code.
- Create a pull request that REFERENCES THE ISSUE # OF THE PROMPT.

Note: If not specified, assume that the program has a driver that asks for user input to test the functions given in the prompt.

### Thanks for your help!
